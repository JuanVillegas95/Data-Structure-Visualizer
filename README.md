# Data Structures Visualizer

> **Note:** This project is currently under development.

This web application visualizes various data structures and algorithms implemented in C, providing an interactive platform to explore their mechanics. By leveraging WebAssembly, we bring high-performance C implementations directly to the browser, offering a hands-on learning tool for data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Dynamically visualize and interact with various data structures in real-time.
- **C and WebAssembly Integration:** Core algorithms and data structures are implemented in C for performance and compiled to WebAssembly for web compatibility.
- **Dynamic UI Elements:** Perform operations such as initialization, modification, and visualization directly from the web interface.
